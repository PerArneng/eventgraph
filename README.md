## What is Event Graph

EventGraph is a powerful command line tool written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) 
that allows  you to take event data and generate a graph that illustrates 
the paths taken, the time each path takes, and how frequently each 
path is taken. With EventGraph, you can easily see patterns and 
trends in your event data that would be difficult to spot using 
traditional methods.
